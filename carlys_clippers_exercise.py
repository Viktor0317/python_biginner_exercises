# Carly's Clippers

# Use your newfound knowledge of loops to discover trends in the operation of
# the newest hair salon in town, Carly’s Clippers.

# You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block.
# Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks.
# You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out
# the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

# You have been provided with three lists:

# - hairstyles: the names of the cuts offered at Carly’s Clippers.
# - prices: the price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list.
# - last_week: the number of purchases for each hairstyle type in the last week.

# Each index in hairstyles corresponds to an associated index in prices and last_week.

# For example, The hairstyle "bouffant" has an associated price of 30 from the prices list,
# and was purchased 2 times in the last week as shown in the last_week list.
# Each of these elements are in the first index of their respective lists.

# Let’s get started!
